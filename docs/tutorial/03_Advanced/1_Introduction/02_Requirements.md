# Advanced iWrap Tutorial: Entry Requirements

## Solid Foundation in iWrap

Successful completion of a beginner-level iWrap course is required. A thorough understanding of fundamental concepts, including code structure and functionalities, is essential for effectively engaging with the advanced material presented in this tutorial.

## Familiarity with MUSCLE3

A basic understanding of `MUSCLE3`'s purpose and functionalities is obligatory. The reader should know about `yMMSL`, the markup language used to describe multiscale models, and the three core components that make up `MUSCLE3`: `libmuscle`, `ymmsl-python`, and `muscle_manager`.

To learn more, visit [MUSCLE3 official documentation](https://muscle3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [yMMSL specification](https://ymmsl-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

## ITER/Gateway Infrastructure Access

While not absolutely mandatory, access to the ITER/Gateway infrastructure can significantly enhance your learning experience. If direct access is unavailable, alternative approach using docker containers is presented.

## Programming proficiency

Some competency in C++ or Fortran as well as Python is required. User should be at least able to read the codes presented as an example.

Familiarity with `MPI` is beneficial. Tutorial delves into parallel programming and understanding of this concepts can be of value. Awareness of MPI functions can also be helpful when reading the code examples.

## Knowledge of code debuggers

Elemental awareness in available code debuggers and ability to use them is a plus. Notable mentions are `TotalView` or `GDB`. These should be helpful when trying to debug iWrapable code.
