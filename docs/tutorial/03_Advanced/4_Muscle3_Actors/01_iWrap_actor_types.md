# iWrap Actor Types: One Code, Many Actor Types

```{admonition} Key takeaways
:class: tip

- iWrap allows a single piece of code to be wrapped into multiple actor types, enhancing code reuse and interoperability in diverse computational workflows.
- Python actors are easy to integrate into Python-based workflows, offering ease of use, debugging support, and robust error handling.
- MUSCLE3 actors support complex multiscale simulations, providing efficient data exchange and fault tolerance.
```

In this chapter, we will explore the versatility of iWrap by delving into the various types of actors it can generate. We'll discuss how iWrap enables a single piece of code to be wrapped into multiple actor types, facilitating integration into diverse computational workflows.

## Introduction to iWrap Actor Types

iWrap is a powerful tool designed to bridge the gap between different programming languages and workflow orchestrators. By generating wrappers, or actors, for your code, iWrap allows seamless integration of computational models into workflows regardless of their original programming language. This modular design enhances code reuse and interoperability, crucial for complex simulations involving multiple physics codes.

## One Code, Many Actor Types: The iWrap Advantage

One of the standout features of iWrap is its ability to generate multiple actor types from a single piece of code. This capability significantly enhances the reusability and interoperability of your computational models.

### Types of iWrap Actors

iWrap supports the creation of several actor types, each tailored for specific scenarios and computational environments. The main types of actors generated by iWrap include:

1. **Python Actors**
2. **MUSCLE3 Actors**

#### Python Actors

Python actors are the simplest and most common type of actors generated by iWrap. They are designed for straightforward integration into Python-based workflows. Python actors wrap your code (e.g., Fortran, C++) and expose it as a Python class. This allows you to leverage the rich ecosystem of Python libraries and tools while running high-performance computations.

**Key Features of Python Actors:**

- **Ease of Use**: Python actors are easy to implement and integrate into existing Python workflows.
- **Debugging Support**: They support debugging modes to help troubleshoot issues.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms for robust error handling.

#### MUSCLE3 Actors

MUSCLE3 actors are designed for more complex, high-performance computing scenarios. They facilitate multiscale simulations by allowing different computational models to interact and exchange data efficiently. MUSCLE3 actors are suitable for workflows that require coordination between multiple codes, potentially running on different computational resources.

**Key Features of MUSCLE3 Actors:**

- **Communication with MUSCLE3 System**: Actors communicate with the MUSCLE3 system through standardized protocols.
- **Inter-Model Communication Management**: Managing communication between different models.
- **Checkpointing and Restarting**: Handling actor checkpointing and restarting to ensure continuity and fault tolerance.

### How It Works

The process of generating different actor types from the same code involves several steps:

1. **Code Description**: Provide a formal description of your code, including details about its methods, arguments, and data types.
2. **Actor Description**: Define the specific characteristics of the actor to be generated, such as its type (Python, MUSCLE3), name, and data handling methods.
3. **iWrap Generation**: Use iWrap's command-line interface or graphical interface to generate the desired actor type based on the provided descriptions.
4. **Integration**: Integrate the generated actor into your workflow, utilizing the specific features and capabilities of the chosen actor type.
