Improvements:
-----------------
* Python 3.7 is outdated - to use Python 3.9 (3.10) as min ver
* Handling of different 'code parameter' types (strings, F namelist)

Generated Py-F actors:
-----------------------
+ extract codes common to all actors to separate 'space' (system module?)
+ improve 'runwork' mechanism


iWrap:
----------------
+ language specific panes plugin discovery mechanism based on implicit namespace packages
+ set iWrap version based on GIT

Open points:
* Should 'call_init' be a part of actor API ?
* Effective memory usage: what about a NUMBER of HUGE IDSes?
* init/step/finish in standalone mode (?)
