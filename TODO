KNOWN ISSUES (to be corrected)
- runtime settings must be set before initialize - misleading - to check if calls can be independent
- input.txt - access denied  - to be run in sandbox

REPORTED BY MIREILLE
- Description of ‘module path’ missing, along with the description on how the fortran code has to be adapted to make it generate the mod file
- Relative paths:
- MPI actors need runtime standalone settings (to be done before initialize() )

Generated Py-F actors:
-----------------------
+ extract codes common to all actors to separate 'space' (system module?)
+ improve 'runwork' mechanism
+ OpenMP
* "per patform" configuration

iWrap:
----------------
+ language specific panes plugin discovery mechanism based on implicit namespace packages
+ make paths relative while saving the project
+ set iWrap version based on GIT
+ INSTALLATION
